	Review = {Nicely written book -- a clear enjoyable read. I only read a little bit of it, the first bit of the chapter about interval estimation, which is a nice heuristic algorithm for doing exploration vs. exploitation in an online learning setting. The algorithm constructs confidence intervals for the mean value of alternatives, and then chooses for measurement the interval with the largest upper bound on its confidence interval. Simple to implement. Also this chapter mentions an algorithm that is comparable to interval estimation by Lai in La87. Lai's algorithm is apparently more complicated but can be shown to be optimal. Though practically Kaelbling claims they perform about the same.},
